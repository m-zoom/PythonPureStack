Objective:
Develop a facial recognition system using OpenCV that can detect and identify individuals by matching a given face against a stored database. The system should return potential matches along with the associated details of the person.

Technology Stack:
OpenCV (for face detection and recognition)

OpenCV Face Recognizer (for training and identifying faces)

Python (as the primary programming language)

NumPy (for handling image data)

SQLite / MySQL / PostgreSQL (for storing person details and image references)

Pandas (for managing structured data if needed)

Functionality Breakdown:
Face Detection & Recognition

Use OpenCV’s pre-trained Haar cascade classifier (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml) or DNN-based face detector to detect faces in an image.

Train OpenCV’s face recognizer (cv2.face.LBPHFaceRecognizer_create()) with labeled images of known individuals.

When a new image is input, the model should compare it with stored faces and return possible matches based on confidence scores.

Data Storage & Retrieval

Store face images in a structured way (file system or database).

Maintain a database linking images to their respective person details (Name, ID, Background Info, etc.).

Use an efficient indexing method for quick face retrieval (e.g., face embeddings stored as feature vectors).

Training the Model

Use a dataset of labeled images to train OpenCV’s face recognizer.

Store trained model weights for future use.

Allow periodic retraining to improve accuracy.

Searching & Matching

When an image is uploaded, the system should scan the database for potential matches.

If a match is found, return the person’s details.

If no match is found, store the new image for future training.

Challenges & Considerations:
How should we efficiently store and retrieve face embeddings?

Should we implement real-time recognition for video input?

How do we handle variations in lighting, angles, and partial occlusions?

What threshold should we set for confident identification?
